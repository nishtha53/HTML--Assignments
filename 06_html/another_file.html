    <h1>Practice Assignment</h1>
    <p>According to consensus in modern genetics, anatomically modern humans first arrived on the Indian subcontinent
        from Africa between 73,000 and 55,000 years ago.[1] However, the earliest known human remains in South Asia date
        to 30,000 years ago. Settled life, which involves the transition from foraging to farming and pastoralism, began
        in South Asia around 7,000 BCE. At the site of Mehrgarh presence can be documented of the domestication of wheat
        and barley, rapidly followed by that of goats, sheep, and cattle.[2] By 4,500 BCE, settled life had spread more
        widely,[2] and began to gradually evolve into the Indus Valley Civilization, an early civilization of the Old
        world, which was contemporaneous with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. This civilisation flourished between 2,500
        BCE and 1900 BCE in what today is Pakistan and north-western India, and was noted for its urban planning, baked
        brick houses, elaborate drainage, and water supply.[3]</p>
    <p>Early on in the second millennium BCE, persistent drought caused the population of the Indus Valley to scatter
        from large urban centres to villages. Around the same time, Indo-Aryan tribes moved into the Punjab from Central
        Asia in several waves of migration. Their Vedic Period (1500â€“500 BCE) was marked by the composition of the
        Vedas, large collections of hymns of these tribes. Their varna system, which evolved into the caste system,
        consisted of a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants. The pastoral and nomadic Indo-Aryans spread
        from the Punjab into the Gangetic plain, large swaths of which they deforested for agriculture usage. The
        composition of Vedic texts ended around 600 BCE, when a new, interregional culture arose. Small chieftaincies,
        or janapadas, were consolidated into larger states, or mahajanapadas, and a second urbanisation took place. This
        urbanisation was accompanied by the rise of new ascetic movements in Greater Magadha, including Jainism and
        Buddhism, which opposed the growing influence of Brahmanism and the primacy of rituals, presided by Brahmin
        priests, that had come to be associated with Vedic religion,[4] and gave rise to new religious concepts.[5] In
        response to the success of these movements, Vedic Brahmanism was synthesised with the preexisting religious
        cultures of the subcontinent, giving rise to Hinduism.</p>
    <p>Most of the Indian subcontinent was conquered by the Maurya Empire during the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE. From the
        3rd century BCE onwards Prakrit and Pali literature in the north and the Tamil Sangam literature in southern
        India started to flourish.[6][7] Wootz steel originated in south India in the 3rd century BCE and was exported
        to foreign countries.[8][9][10] During the Classical period, various parts of India were ruled by numerous
        dynasties for the next 1,500 years, among which the Gupta Empire stands out. This period, witnessing a Hindu
        religious and intellectual resurgence, is known as the classical or "Golden Age of India". During this period,
        aspects of Indian civilisation, administration, culture, and religion (Hinduism and Buddhism) spread to much of
        Asia, while kingdoms in southern India had maritime business links with the Middle East and the Mediterranean.
        Indian cultural influence spread over many parts of Southeast Asia, which led to the establishment of Indianised
        kingdoms in Southeast Asia (Greater India).[11][12]</p>
